UniVods - Uni Videos on Demand
==============================

UniVods is an Android Application made to availbale to students of Flinders University. The goal is to provide a easy way to watch the lectures in Tablets or phones without login in the student website. In the future there we would like to implement a "share" features where students will be able to add notes and share them with other users about the lecture.
