UniVods - Uni Videos on Demand
==============================

UniVods is an Android Application made to available to students of Flinders University. The goal is to provide an easy way to watch lectures in Tablets or phones without login in the students website. In the future there we would like to implement a "share" feature where students will be able to add notes and share them.

To use the application enter your topic numbers to be added to the database. The application has a internal database with all the topics offered by Flinders University.
