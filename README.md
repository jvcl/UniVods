UniVods - Uni Videos on Demand
==============================

UniVods is an Android Application made to availbale to students of Flinders University. The goal is to provide a easy way to watch the lectures in Tablets or phones without login in the student website. In the future there we would like to implement a "share" features where students will be able to add notes and share them with other users about the lecture.

To use the application enter your topic numbers to be added to the database. The application has a internal database with all the topics offered by Flinders University. 

The application will let you know if the topic you are looking have videos available to show.
